#Countdown by Fours - Print positive numbers starting at 2018, counting down by fours.
# for countdown_by_fours in range(2018, -1, -4):
#     print(countdown_by_fours)

#Flexible Counter - Set three variables: lowNum, highNum, mult. Starting at lowNum and going through highNum, print only the integers that are a multiple of mult. For example, if lowNum=2, highNum=9, and mult=3, the loop should print 3, 6, 9 (on successive lines)

low_num = 2
high_num = 9
mult = 3
